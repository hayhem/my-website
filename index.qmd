### Hello!
I'm Hayley Hemme and I'm a first-year PhD student at the University of Georgia working with Andreas Handel and his group. Please take a look around to see what I've been up to and also check out the [Handel Research Group](https://handelgroup.uga.edu/) page to learn more about the group.

#### This website is a work in progress

<!-- Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:hayleyhemme@uga.edu) if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects. -->
